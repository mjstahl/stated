# Stated
Simply put state management for your JavaScript application. Pushdown automata
(FSM with history) in less than 900 B.

## Installation

```js
$ npm install --save @mjstahl/stated
```

```js
// as a factory function
const stated = require('@mjstahl/stated')

// as a class expression
const { Stated } = require('@mjstahl/stated')
```

## API

`stated(states: Object[, persistent: Boolean]) -> Stated`

`new Stated(states: Object[, persistent: Boolean]) -> Stated`

To create an instance of Stated pass a 'states' object. A valid states object
must have an, at least, a single state and an 'initial' property referencing
that state by its name.

By default each Stated object is not persistent. If you wish to store
each state change pass 'true' as the second argument to the constructor.

```js
const h20 = stated({
  initial: 'water',
  water: {
    // actions must reference existing states
    FROZEN: 'ice',
    BOILED: 'steam',
    // Number, Array, Function, Object, etc
    value: '60F'
  },
  ice: {
    BOILED: 'steam',
    WARMED: 'water',
    value: '32F'
  },
  steam: {
    COOLED: 'water',
    FROZEN: 'ice',
    value: {
      temp: '212F'
    }
  }
})

h20.state //-> 'water'
h20.value //-> '60F'
```

`<stated>.to(action: String[, updateValue: Any]) -> Stated`

Transition from the current state to a new state. If called with a second
argument. The value of the new state will be updated with the value. If value
is an Object, the current value and `updateValue` will be merged. If the
`updateValue` is not an Object, value will be replaced with `updateValue`.

```js
  h20.to(h20.actions.FROZEN)

  h20.state //-> 'ice'
  h20.value //-> '32F'

  h20.to(h20.actions.BOILED, { state: 'gas' })

  h20.value //-> { state: 'gas', temp: '212F' }
```

`<stated>.reset() -> Stated`

Set the Stated object's state to initial state.

```js
  h20.reset()

  h20.state //-> 'water'
  h20.value //-> '60F'
```

`<stated>.actions -> Object`

Return an object with actions as properties and associated values. Provided to
avoid typos when traversing states. For example:

```js
h20.to(h20.actions.BOILED)
h20.actions

//-> { 'FROZEN': 'FROZEN', 'COOLED': 'COOLED' }
```

`actions` only includes actions related to the current state. So
attempting to call `to` with an invalid action will cause a runtime error
as that action does not exist on `<stated>.actions`.

**For a state that does not have any `actions` all the states of the Stated
object will available from `actions`.**

`<stated>.state -> String`

Return the name of the Stated's current state.

```js
  h20.state

  //-> 'steam'
```

`<stated>.value -> Any`

Returns the value of the current state if one exists; returns `undefined`
if not.

```js
  h20.to(h20.actions.WARMED)
  h20.value

  //-> '60F'
```

## Guards

Each state may have a `canEnter` and `canLeave` function that is executed
when attempting to leave one state and enter another. Each function takes
one argument, the Stated object, for use during its execution.

When a transition is occurring (via the `on` method), if there is a `canLeave` function on the current state, it is executed. If the `canLeave` function returns `true` and the future state has a `canEnter` function, the `canEnter` function is
executed. If the `canEnter` function of the future state returns true, the Stated object is transitioned successfully.

If either the `canLeave` or `canEnter` functions exist and return false, the transition does not occur.

`.canLeave(self: Stated) -> Boolean`

`.canEnter(self: Stated) -> Boolean`

## Transition Functions

Each state can have an `onLeave` and `onEnter` function that is executed when
leaving one state, and having entered another. This are useful for performing
side-effects.

`.onLeave(self: Stated) -> Void`

Executed when a transition is to occur but before the current state has been
replaced with the next state.

```js
const h20 = stated({
  initial: 'water',
  water: {
    FROZEN: 'ice',
    value: '60F'
    onLeave: () => console.log('Winter is Coming!!!')
  },
  ice: {
    WARMED: 'water',
    value: '32F'
  },
})

h20.to(h20.actions.FROZEN)

//-> 'Winter is Coming!!!'
```

`.onEnter(self: Stated) -> Void`

Executed after the state and values have been updated, history has recorded (if
persistent), and `'transition'` event has been emitted.

```js
const h20 = stated({
  initial: 'water',
  water: {
    FROZEN: 'ice',
    value: '60F'
    onLeave: () => console.log('Winter is Coming!!!')
  },
  ice: {
    WARMED: 'water',
    value: '32F'
    onEnter: () => console.log('Winter is Here!!!')
  },
})

h20.to(h20.actions.FROZEN)

//-> 'Winter is Coming!!!'
//-> 'Winter is Here!!!'
```

## Events

Each stated object is also an EventEmitter. When the Stated object transitions
from one state to another the `'transition'` event is emitted with the Stated
object passed the only argument to the callback.

`<stated>.on(callback: Function) -> Function`

```js
  const unbind = h20.on('transition', ({ state, value }) => {
    console.log(state) //-> 'water'
    console.log(value) //-> '60F'
  })
  h20.reset()

  // when you are finished listening
  unbind()
```

## Persistence

Each Stated object is can be persistent and store each state change,
allowing the user to `undo` and `redo` states. Use can turn persistence
on and off with the `persistent` property. You can make Stated object
persistent by default by passing `true` as the second argument to the
constructor.

`<stated>.persistent -> Boolean`

`new Stated({... states, true})`

Toggle whether the Stated object will store each state change.

```js
h20.persistant //-> false, Stated objects are not persistent by default

// To turn on persistence, simply set 'persistent' to 'true'
h20.persistent = true
```

`<stated>.undo() -> Stated`

Return to a previous state. If the current state is the initial state and
`undo` is called, the Stated object will be returned without performing a
state transition (in the initial state).

```js
  h20.to(h20.actions.FROZEN)
  h20.state //-> 'ice'

  h20.undo()
  h20.state //-> 'water'
```

`<stated>.redo() -> Stated`

Re-apply a later state. If the current state is the top of the stack of states
and `redo` is called, the Stated object will be returned without performing a
state transition (the current state will remain equal to the state at the
top of the stack).

```js
  h20.to(h20.actions.FROZEN)
  h20.state //-> 'ice'

  h20.undo()
  h20.state //-> 'water'

  h20.redo()
  h20.state //-> 'ice'
```
